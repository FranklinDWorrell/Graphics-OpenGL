The projects in this repository where created for a graduate-level course in
computer graphics in OpenGL (CSCI 5631). The first assignment demonstrated 
competency in C++. In our second assignment, we drew the Koch Snowflake (both
iteratively and recursively for bonus points). The next programming assignment
asked us to produce data structures appropriate for displaying the Utah Teapot
as a wire frame and as a solid object with either flat or Gouraud shading. 
Finally, we implemented code that drew the Teapot using our data structures.
The course was completed in Fall 2016.
